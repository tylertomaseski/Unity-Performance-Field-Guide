**If you follow some of the tips given here, you'll have to optimize a lot less later.** The best way to optimize your game is to build good habits.

**What’s the best way to optimize your game?** _**It’s to write it performant in the first place!**_ Performance is all about good habits, so you can write performant code without slowing down production. Part of why doing that is so hard, is that sometimes you don’t know the best way or the pitfalls of the engine until it’s too late. This field-guide is an attempt to articulate a series of from-the-trenches tips and tricks. 

The Unity Performance Field Guide is put together as an effort to concentrate knowledge shared in [Society of Play](https://societyofplay.net/) community discussions into a single reference point.
