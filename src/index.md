### About

**The best way to optimize your game is to build good habits** and write decently performant code the first time on instinct.

Part of why doing that is so hard, is that sometimes you don’t know the best way or the pitfalls of the engine until it’s too late. **This field-guide is an attempt to articulate a series of from-the-trenches tips and tricks. So you can build good habits and generate less optimization work for yourself later.**

This guide concentrates knowledge from [Society of Play](https://societyofplay.net/) community discussions into a single reference point.
