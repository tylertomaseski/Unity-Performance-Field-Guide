**The best way to optimize your game is to build good habits** and write decently performant code the first time on instinct.

Part of why doing that is so hard, is that sometimes you don’t know the best way or the pitfalls of the engine until it’s too late. **This field-guide is an attempt to articulate a series of from-the-trenches tips and tricks. So you can build good habits and generate less optimization work for yourself later.**

This guide is an effort to concentrate knowledge from [Society of Play](https://societyofplay.net/) community discussions into a single reference point.

**Curator + Writer:** Tyler Tomaseski<br />
**Optitmization Contributors:** Adam Strick, Scott Robertson, & Liz Gravis


The Unity Performance Field-Guide is an [open-source project and can be found here](https://github.com/tylertomaseski/Unity-Performance-Field-Guide). Have tips? I'll soon be adding a guide to the Git Repo on how to contribute tips!
