Transform.position and other extern APIs
<!--instead-of-->
<p>Using Transform.position, Transform.rotation, etc. multiple times per-frame</p>
<!--try-->
<p>Access any Transform data you need twice per simulation step in an IJobParallelForTransform job: once for reading from Transforms, once for writing to them.</p>
<!--because-->
<p>Transform access is slow. It involves expensive managed/native interop and struct copying.</p>
