Game Initialization
<!--instead-of-->
<p>Static initializers or static constructors for static variables. Multiple [InitializeOnLoad].</p>
<!--try-->
<p>Create one specific unified initialization routine to run for each of Unityâ€™s initialization callbacks and attributes (like [InitializeOnLoad]).</p>
<!--because-->
<p>Static initializers make editor performance slower during startup, compiling, play mode entry/exit, and a few other places. They also inject a small amount of overhead for any code that accesses the class with the static initializer or constructor, which adds up.</p>
