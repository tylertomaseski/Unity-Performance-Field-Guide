Deep transform hierarchies
<!--instead-of-->
<p>Maintaining large Transform hierarchies (for UI or temporary shared motion or scene organization)</p>
<!--try-->
<p>Keep Transform hierarchies as flat as possible</p>
<!--because-->
<p>They make internal per-frame Transform operations slower. Transform hierarchies reduce the multithreading ability of the animation system and IJobParallelForTransform jobs. They make most UI operations slower.</p>
<p>If you NEED to maintain deep transform parenting, consider unparenting objects at runtime.</p>
