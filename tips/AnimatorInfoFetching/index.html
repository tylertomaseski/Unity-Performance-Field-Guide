Animator Key Hashing
<!--instead-of-->
<p>Setting and getting values from animators with strings.</p>
<!--try-->
<p>Generating string hashes once and then using generated ints.</p>
<!--because-->
<p>Every time you pass a string to an animator, it will &quot;hash&quot; the string. Which is slow. You can instead do this once on your end, and reuse the generated integer id.</p>
