<!--instead-of-->
<p>Using C#'s Dictionary. Especially if you're using string-keys.</p>
<!--try-->
<p>An int-key dictionary. Or even better, an alternative data-structure.</p>
<p>For game catered datastructures, <a href="https://github.com/dotBunny/GDX">check out GDX</a>. GDX is an open-source collection of custom data-types geared towards gamedev and performance.</p>

<p>C#'s built in data types are geared towards maximum flexibility and sacrifice performance for it. <b>Especially string-key dictionaries.</b> String-key dictionaries will hash strings every time you use it, which is very slow.</p>
