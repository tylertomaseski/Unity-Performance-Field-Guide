Avoid default C# Data Structures
<!--instead-of-->
<p>List, SparseSet, Dictionary, Etc.</p>
<!--try-->
<p>GDX, an open-source collection of custom data-types geared towards gamedev and performance.</p>
<!--because-->
<p>C#'s built in data types are geared towards maximum flexibility and sacrifice performance for it. GDX is an amazing collection of gamedev oriented data-types with a performance-first attitude.</p>
<p>Getting the right data-type will not only be faster, but give you catered architecture to best solve your problems</p>
