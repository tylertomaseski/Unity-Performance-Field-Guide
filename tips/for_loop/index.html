Check array length once in a for-loop
<!--instead-of-->
<p>Checking a collections length inside the for-loop.</p>
<!--try-->
<p>Cache the collections length and use the cached int in the for-loop.</p>
<!--because-->
<p>The compiler doesn't know if you've edited the array, so it politely asks the collection every for-loop what it's length is. This isn't a hurculean task, but it takes a little time. And this adds up across your entire code-base!</p>
